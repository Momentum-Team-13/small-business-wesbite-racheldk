    <h3>Wild hyacinth</h3>
    <img src="starter_files/images/wild-hyacinth.jpg" alt="wild hyacinth: a pretty purple flower with six petals">
    <p>This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus. It will grow
        in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows or prairies. Additionally it is
        found growing alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have withered.
        Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.</p>
    <h3>Lily of the Valley</h3>

        alt="lily of the valley: small white flowers hanging from a green stem">
    <p>With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge bells that dangle above bright emerald-green leaves -- this
        nearly deer-proof shade lover appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned way. But the pretty plant is also an
        intrepid wanderer, spreading readily and rapidly, and anyone who gardens in a small space will want to watch
        this perennial to make sure it stays in bounds. Tolerates shade well. <strong>**Warning: this plant is
            poisonous.**</strong></p>

    <p>Crown imperials are strong-growing bulbous plants, making rapid growth in the spring, flowering during
        April/early May and dying down in early summer. Best in raised beds or planters. Does not tolerate shade; needs
        a warm, sunny position where it can be left undisturbed for many years.</p>

        alt="Persion Buttercup: a pretty yellow flower with many, many petals">
    <p>This species of buttercup can get up to 2 feet tall and has large showy blooms in a variety of colors from May to
        June. Persian buttercups are most commonly grown from tubers planted in the beginning of spring. Each plant will
        produce up to 70 blooms in a season. Good for cooler weather; can tolerate light frost.</p>
    <h3>Spring starflower</h3>
    <img src="starter_files/images/spring-starflower.jpg"
        alt="Spring starflower: many purple flowers with dark centers and six petals">
    <p>These charming little blooming plants hail from Argentina and Uruguay and form dense clumps of perennial flowers
        to chase the winter doldrums away. These flowers spring from fall planted bulbs. They can get up to half a foot
        tall with a similar spread. Each bulb will produce numerous flowering stems with slender, deeply green foliage.
        Blooms are fragrant and star shaped with six blue or white petals.</p>
    <h3>Tulips</h3>
    <img src="starter_files/images/tulips.jpg"
        alt="Tulips: red and yellow tulips growing taller than surrounding flowers">
    <p>We have a wide variety of tulips in many colors. Plant tulip bulbs in the fall, 6 to 8 weeks before a hard frost
        is expected and when soils are below 60 degrees F.</p>
